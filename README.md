# Similarity_images
This project is to find similair images using the deep learning(saimese network)

In this folder you will find:

The template folder contains the .caffemodel 

Retrival: a small folder that contains images retrieval. The retrieval images are illustrated in a .txt file: retrival_data_base.txt


The siamese_similarity_AK.py script extracts a single branch (for feature extraction) and finds the most similar images (using Euclidean distance). Thank you for reading the comments added in the script.

To test the similarity, you can use the image "test.jpg"

Do not hesitate to contact me for any questions.
